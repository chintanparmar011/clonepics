1. Problem: High Cost of VR Headset Development
➡ Solution: Start with outsourcing or white-labeling existing hardware; later move to in-house development when funding allows.

2. Problem: Low awareness or understanding of VR among general users
➡ Solution: Run educational campaigns, demo events at colleges, and create tutorials inside the app.

3. Problem: Limited design content in the beginning
➡ Solution: Onboard early creators/designers by offering incentives (revenue share, exposure, contests) and we can also provide design based on customer requrment.

4. Problem: Compatibility issues with different devices
➡ Solution: Develop app with cross-platform support (VR, mobile, PC), and optimize for popular devices first.

5. Problem: Users uploading low-quality or inappropriate designs
➡ Solution: Implement a content moderation system + user reporting + AI filter for design quality.

6. Problem: Difficulty in attracting paying customers initially
➡ Solution: Start with a freemium model—free content + paid premium/custom designs to grow user base first.

7. Problem: Technical bugs in VR app or headset
➡ Solution: Regular testing, beta versions for feedback, and quick patch updates.

8. Problem: Privacy and intellectual property issues with uploaded designs
➡ Solution: Add clear copyright policies, allow creators to license their designs, and use secure cloud storage.

9. Problem: Difficulty in scaling design-on-demand service
➡ Solution: Use AI-assisted design tools and hire a small team of freelance designers to handle custom orders.

10. Problem: Competition from big companies like Meta, Google (in VR space)
➡ Solution: Focus on your niche—affordable design visualization + creator marketplace—something the big players don’t focus on.
